### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I love building up eveything, making it the most similar to the original. I think the hardest part for me is making the entire design responsive. I'm learning while doing these so I still need more practice. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I practiced a lot of GRID and FLEX in this challenge, because I'm just a newbie in this topics and I feel like I'm improving a lot with every challenge I complete. 

### Continued development

I need to focus in learning Responsive Design, because it keeps being a headache every time!!

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helps me every time I code!
